"Half a Bottle of Perfume","Recently, my mother has been acting strangely, secretly using my perfume and wearing my clothes, even sneaking out at midnight. One day, I couldn't hold back and confronted her, leading to an argument. Accidentally, I pushed her to the ground. Rushing to help her up, I found my hands covered in fresh blood.","My mother passed away a few days ago. Her death dealt a severe blow to me, inducing hallucinations and sleepwalking. At night, I find myself dressing in the beautiful clothes and perfume my mother left me, wandering to her grave to speak with her.

'I found you.'","Having accidentally witnessed a murder, I became the target of the killer's pursuit. In desperation, I hid in a bathroom, listening as his footsteps grew nearer. Just when the footsteps seemed to recede, giving me a false sense of security, my accidental flushing of the toilet drew the killer back. Peeking under the door, he ominously stated, 'I found you,' with the increasing 'drips' indicating his approaching presence, and the 'bang bang bang' being the sound of him knocking on the bathroom door."
"Grandma's Apples","At age 6, my grandma told me not to eat yellow apples. At 13, she warned me against green apples. At 18, she cautioned me about red apples. After she passed away at 20, I prayed to her, hoping I can enjoy all apples freely.","Our family, living in poverty, depended solely on my grandmother's apple orchard. Following my brother's birth, I felt neglected, prompting my grandmother to grow poisonous apples as a form of protection. These actions led to a solitude shared only between us. As I grew, she continued to use the apples to shield me from harm until her death, which quieted the village's whispers. Under the apple tree, I whispered a prayer to my grandmother, allowing myself the freedom to enjoy any apple, marking the end of our silent battle against the world."

"The Strange Mark","Returning home from studying abroad, I noticed an 'X' written next to our door, which I casually erased. However, it reappeared by evening.

The next morning, the 'X had changed to an 'O. Just as I was puzzled, the neighbor's door opened, and I realized danger was imminent...","Previously, a tragic accident in our building led to a boy's death. His father, seeking vengeance for the unresolved tragedy, marked the doors of residents, with 'X indicating his actions of retribution and 'O' marking those next in line.

"The Elevator","I entered the elevator to go to school, but as it ascended, I knew I could never go to school again."," On a Monday morning, urged by my mother, I absent-mindedly entered the elevator for school. Forgetting to press for the ground floor, the elevator kept rising. Just as I was about to correct this, it stopped, and the doors opened to reveal a girl in a pool of blood and a man cleaning up. The man, noticing me, stared intently at my hand. Startled, I frantically pressed the elevator button to close the door. As it nearly shut, a bloody hand reached in, confirming my fears of never reaching school. (The elevator's ascent was triggered by the girl pressing the button for help before being murdered.)"

I confided in the doll about my boyfriend's abuse. After one of his assaults, he left, and I cried myself to sleep.
